# Xcode C++ class template

A C++ class (with implementation and header files) with optional virtual destructor and hidden copy/assign operations for Xcode 6 and 7.

## Installation

Copy the "C++ Class.xctemplate" directory to "/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates/C and C++" on your Mac (if it doesn't exist, create it). Tested with Xcode 6, 7 and 8 but it should also work with earlier versions of Xcode.

## Usage

To create a new C++ class, choose File/New/File... (or press Command+N) and choose "C++ Class" in the "C and C++" tab.
